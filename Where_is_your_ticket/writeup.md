# Challenge `Where is your ticket?`

* Source: https://github.com/manrop2702/ISITDTU2021/blob/main/Where_is_your_ticket/challenge/wheres_your_ticket.py

* Description: 
    - All the rich (**_royal_**) people are invited to my party. I will show them my big and shiny secret Flag.
    - No peasant is allowed.
    - Information about you is encrypted, it will be your identity.
    - The guards will check your identity with the **_Signature_** before letting you in, so don't think about lying.

* Server: `nc 34.125.6.66 5000`

Access to the server and you will see this:

Basically, the challenge give us a role as a <span style="color:green">guest</span>. Base on the description or the source code, we should find a way to change our identity to <span style="color:red">royal</span>
